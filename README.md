# CosMIC

This repository contains the current python implementation of 'CosMIC' (a Consistent Metric for spike Inference from Calcium imaging). This metric is designed to assess the similarity between true and estimated spike trains. For technical details, see the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1162/neco_a_01114).
